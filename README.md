# 3d-RAYCASTING-SHOOTER
This is a simple pygame raycaster. Floor and ceiling created by someone else, everything else my own work from a c++ tutorial translated into python 
Controls: WASD, click to shoot, r to reload, run over ammo to pick up.
M on title screen to access and edit map by pressing numbers for different textures and clicking where you want to place them.
